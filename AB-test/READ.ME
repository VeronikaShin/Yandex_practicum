1. evaluate the correctness of the test launch, the formation of groups, etc.
2. analyzed the results of the A / B test, 
3. built graphs conversions by group, and then calculated the statistical significance of conversion differences. 
Based on my analysis, I made a decision about the incorrectness of the launch of the test and the inappropriateness of further testing.

were used: pandas, numoy, scipy, proportions_ztest, seaborn, plotly
