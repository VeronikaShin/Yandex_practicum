The task is to evaluate the results of the A / B test. There is a dataset with user actions, a technical task and several auxiliary datasets.

Need:

Evaluate the correctness of the test:
intersection of the test audience with a competing test,
coincidence of the test and marketing events, other problems of time limits of the test.
Analyze test results
Step 1. Data preprocessing

Step 2. Evaluate the correctness of the test:

Compliance of data with the requirements of the technical specifications. Check the correctness of all points of the technical task.
The time of the test. Make sure it doesn't overlap with marketing and other activities.
test audience. Make sure there are no overlaps with a competing test and no users participating in two test groups at the same time. Check the uniformity of distribution among the test groups and the correctness of their formation.
Step 3.EDA:

Are the number of events per user equally distributed across the samples?
How is the number of events in the samples distributed over the days?
How does the conversion in the funnel change in the samples at different stages?
What features of the data should be taken into account before proceeding with A / B testing?
Step 4. Evaluate the results of A / B testing:

What can you say about the results of A/B testing?
Check the statistical difference of proportions by z-test.
Step 5. Conclusions
