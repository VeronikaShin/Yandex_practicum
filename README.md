## Game project:

Analysis of the success of computer games.
it was necessary to identify patterns for the Strimchik (online store) that determine the success of the game according to data up to 2016. 
This would allow Strimchik to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
I used data up to 2016 to calculate the advertising campaign for 2017. I was looking for principles of working with data in order to predict sales for any year in principle.

**In this project were made:** EDA, a portrait of the user of each region was compiled and hypotheses were tested.

## Start up progect: 

In the startup that sells food, I needed to figure out how users of a mobile application behave.

**In the project were studied:** the sales funnel, the share of users who reached the purchase, the results of the A/A/B experiment.
Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones. I had to figure out which font was better.
