Final project 1:

Analysis of the success of computer games.
it was necessary to identify patterns for the Strimchik (online store) that determine the success of the game according to data up to 2016. 
This would allow Strimchik to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
I used data up to 2016 to calculate the advertising campaign for 2017. I was looking for principles of working with data in order to predict sales for any year in principle.

were using: pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib.
